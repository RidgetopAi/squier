This is a sample text file for testing the document extraction system.

It contains multiple paragraphs of text that can be used to verify
that the extraction and chunking functionality works correctly.

The Squire project is an AI memory system designed to help users
manage and retrieve important information through natural language
conversations. It uses embeddings and semantic search to find
relevant memories and context.

Key Features:
- Document extraction from multiple formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD)
- Semantic chunking for RAG applications
- Vector embeddings for similarity search
- Living summaries that evolve over time

This document should be extracted successfully and split into
multiple chunks when using the chunking system.
